# Development manual

## Requirements
* Git
* Java 8+ (either openjdk or oraclejdk should work)
* Gradle

## Testing
To test the application run `gradle check`, all new code should be tested.

## Building the jar file
Building the jar file is as simple as running `gradle jar`. That will deposit a jar file inside `build/libs`
which you can run.
